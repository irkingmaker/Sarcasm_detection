# Sarcasm_detection
Implemented various machine learning/Deep learning algorithms for sarcasm detection
Preprocessing of sarcasm_headlines dataset from kaggle.
Implemented the following algorithms on the dataset for detection:
1. LSTM
2. Support vector machines(linear kernel)
3. Gaussian naive bayes classifier
4. Logistic regression
5. Random forest classifier
